# YAX
A small, preemptively-multitasking, 32-bit x86 operating system kernel.
(The name means Yet Another uniX).
## The idea
Write a Unix-like microkernel with a Plan 9-inspired VFS as IPC.
I hope it works.
## Current status
It doesn't do much by now, I have only begun to implement the VFS which is the
most important part, but it already manages memory and multitasks.
See src/STATUS for an overview.
## License stuff
It is under the public domain or CC0 if your country doesn't understand that.
